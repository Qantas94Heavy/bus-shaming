=What is this and why is this here?=

When I started this project it was a simple learning exercise to brush up on Java and learn Spring and Cassandra. It was a very successful learning experience and I learned that Spring and Cassandra were both terrible choices.

I later decided that this would be better in Python and rewrote it. This folder will be deleted eventually once all ther relevant parts have been reimplemented.

Read it, use it if you want but I wouldn't recommend it.
